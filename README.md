## Abstract
Overlook Booking is a site where customers can come and make a reservation for the Overlook Hotel. The user will be able to log in, see previous bookings, view the amount they've spent previously at Overlook Hotesl, and make new bookings. The site allows you to input a date, and view bookings still available on that date. Users can also filter their search by the room type. 

## Technologies
  - Javascript
  - Sass
  - apis
  - mocha & chai

## Install + Setup

  - run "npm start"

## Wins
  - Getting the required iterations done while sick
  - I did some HTML and CSS art on the first day, but ultimately got rid of it. 

## Challenges + Improvements
  - I was unaware of the date input type so I ended up hard coding something similar. 
  - I struggled to get more than the MVP done, and didn't really get to express myself in the project given the time limit.
